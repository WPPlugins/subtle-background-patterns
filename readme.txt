No, absolutly not. The patterns are pulled from a Github Repository as you see them. Once you add a pattern as background, it is added to your media library.

As written above, once installed no other service is used. 
There might be a downtime from github some day, then the patterns will no be pulled for selection. But i don`t think that happened before.
